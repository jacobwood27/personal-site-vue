What!? The internet is incredibly vague with information of climbing in the Mount Baldy Area. Like it describes the 'Rock Garden\" in the Baldy Bowl (which I will climb soon-all easy stuff), and a few areas with one or so mediocre climbable boulder. I think there was some friction with local landowners so its all been hush-hush. <br/><br/>This area is actually called \"Mount Baldy Hillside Boulders\" on Mountain Project, but the entry trail starts immediately opposite the school so it feels way more self explanatory this way. The only climb listed in this area is \"Spaceship X\"... I actually never found \"Spaceship X\" this day, even though there is literally GPS coordinates on MP comments. Anyway, from some scoping a previous day I saw a boulder up the hill that looked like it had potential. I saw the remnants of what I thought might be a climber trail and took a peek. The trail quickly and completely disappeared but I pushed through some sharp Yucca and saw remnants of some old but unmistakable trail makings. There were obvious saw marks and moved branches that formed a kind of tunnel. It was vastly overgrown but I knew my destination and protected with a pair of high thigh board shorts and a Pickle Rick tank I proceeded to do the worst bushwhack I've ever done. Every plant was seeding so i was covered head to toe with all kinds of flora, the most interesting of which was this plant which had \"wishie\" looking pods that each had hundreds of hairy caterpillar looking seeds. Needless to say is was itchy, bleeding, dirty and excited as hell.<br/><br/>The boulder has an incredible aesthetic overhanging sharp arete, with a ~20' tall slab to the left and a maybe 30 degree overhanging face on the right. It has a bolt on top of the boulder. This climb starts sitting on the obvious arete but trends slightly right to holds on the overhang. With an insanely cool toe hook you span up to the end of the overhang and do some tension moves to finish. For how so-so the rock quality in the area in general this climb feels bullet! <br/><br/>So I did describe how good the bushwhack was right? And how much clothing protection I had on right? Well, as I'm walking around the boulder, I see a plant I think I recognize and it triggers great fear. Poison Oak. And its goddamn everywhere. <br/><br/>I'm still not 100% sure it was, but since that day I have been hyper sensitive to even the faintest itch in Great Fear that I will break out in the worst poison oak rash this world has seen. The oil in Poison Oak is called \"Urushiol\" and I PRNF dub this in the plants honor. Fuck Me.", "rating": 3, "grade": "6"},
