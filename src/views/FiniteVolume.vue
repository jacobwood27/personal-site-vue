          I developed a two dimensional finite volume solver for a supersonic
          jet inlet. MacCormacks Method with artificial dissipation was
          utilized. Please view the

          <a href="pdf/2d-supersonic-jet-inlet-report.pdf">full report</a> and
          checkout the source code on my github page to see the awesomeness.
          This project was done using MATLAB R2015a Student Version. The above
          figure is sample of the results section showing how the mach number
          drops abruptly across the oblique shocks. These oblique shocks are
          used intentionaly in jet engine inlets to slow down supersonic air.
